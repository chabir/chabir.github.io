<a id="short-bio" class="anchor" href="#short-bio" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Short bio:</h2>

<p>I studied engineering at EIVP, Ecole des Ingenieurs de la Ville de Paris (Urban Sciences) after three years of intensive maths and physics. Following the path of my grand father, I studied hydraulic  and fluids mechanics in particular with a strong interest for modeling and coding. I had a lot of fun during my 4 internships in the Paris sewage network and diverse water department to learn the job.
My first full time job was in a small but great research department in public transportation. The company was, among other things, in charge of the IT infrastructure to broadcast messages on the highway around Paris. I wrote and created experimentations for buses related to the message broadcast and bus priority and made some software developments.
Then, after hesitating between another architecture or finance diploma to complete my master in engineering, I decided for a Master of Corporate finance in EM Lyon (top 4th French Business school). Given a mix of luck and some excellent mentors, I ended up working for several financial institution in Paris and New York where I was in charge of modeling financial and insurance related deals for underwriting or trading purposes. These years were really intense, a lot of hard work and a great start for a career with a mix economy, finance, coding, maths and stats...</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I love maths, physics, finance, economy and that I had a lot of fun in my previous jobs, I recently got a real and strong interest for data science and machine learning. In my past experience, I worked with large spreadsheets, model financial cash flows under numerous scenarios, digged into financial statement of insurance company to understand the behavious of financial and worked with actuaries who seems to be really comfortable to aggregate different concepts into a single model, but now, I see data projects and modeling differently as the scale of the data can be multiplied. 
After attending a few meetup (Open Data by Vivian and Data Driven by Matt Turk) in New York, I decided to take the actuarial exams to be more comfortable with statistics and probabilities and to take the NYC Data Science 3 months bootcamp during the summer 2015. I am still amazed by all the coding techniques I learnt, all the possibilities for data and modeling that it opened and Machine learning is also really amazing tool. I can now spend hours and hours trying to figure out how to find the best path, using coding and my own intuition, to solve larger scale data related problems in diverse field such as transportation, marketing, advertizing...</p>
