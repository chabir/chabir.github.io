## Short bio:
I studied engineering at EIVP, Ecole des Ingenieurs de la Ville de Paris (Urban Sciences) after three years of intensive maths and physics. Following the path of my grand father, I studied hydraulic in particular and fluids mechanics with a strong interest for modeling and coding. I had a lot during my 4 internships in the sewages and diverse water department to learn the job.
My first job was in a small but great research department in public transportation. The company was, among other things, in charge of the IT infrastructure to broadcast messages on the highway around Paris. I wrote and created an experimentations for buses related to the message broadcast and bus priority and made some software developments.
Then, after hesitating between another architecture or finance diploma to complete my master in engineering, I decided for a Master of Corporate finance in EMLyon (top French Business school). With a mix of luck and some excellent mentors, I ended up working for several financial institution in Paris and New York where I was in charge of modeling financial and insurance related deals for underwriting or trading purposes. These years were really intense, a great start for a career with a mix economy, finance, coding, maths and stats...

## Data Science:
Depite the fact that I love maths, physics, finance, economy and I had a lot of fun in my previous jobs, I recently got a real and strong interest for data science and machine learning. Before, I worked with large spreadsheets, model financial cash flows under numerous scenarios, digged into financial statement of insurance company to understand the behavious of financial and worked with actuaries who seems to be really confortable to aggregate different concepts into a single model. After attending a few meetup (Open Data by Vivian and Data Driven by Matt Turk) in New York, I decided to take the actuarial exams to be more confortable with statistics and proabilities and to take the NYC Data Science 3 months bootcamp during the summer 2015. I am still amazed by all the technics in coding we learnt and all the possibilities that it opened and Machine learning is also really amazing. I can spend hours trying to figure out how to find the best path using coding and intuition to solve data related problems.

I love DIY, wind surfing and hicking.
